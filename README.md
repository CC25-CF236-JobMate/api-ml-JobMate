# JobMate ML API

This repository contains the backend machine learning service for the **JobMate** platform. The API provides intelligent job recommendation and classification functionalities, designed to be a scalable and secure microservice running on Google Cloud.

## Live API Endpoint

You can access the live JobMate ML API at:

[https://jobmate-api-705829099986.asia-southeast2.run.app](https://jobmate-api-705829099986.asia-southeast2.run.app)

## Features

- **Resume-Based Job Recommendation**: Recommends the top 5 most relevant jobs by analyzing the text of a user's resume and calculating cosine similarity against a database of job vectors.
- **Job Category Prediction**: Predicts the category of a job (e.g., "Software Development," "Healthcare") based on its description using a trained supervised learning model.
- **Centralized Model Management**: All ML models and data are loaded dynamically from a Google Cloud Storage bucket, allowing for updates without redeploying the application code.
- **Secure API**: Endpoints are protected via Bearer Token authentication.
- **Containerized & Cloud-Native**: Packaged with Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Run for scalability and reliability.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask, Gunicorn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Run, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Build
- **Environment Management**: python-dotenv
- **Containerization**: Docker

Setup and Development
Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root with the following variables:

bash
Salin
# The name of the GCS bucket where models are stored
BUCKET_NAME="model-ml-jobmate"

# The secret token required to authenticate with the API
API_TOKEN="mysecretbearer123"
Local Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Salin
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Salin
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Salin
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Application Credentials: To access the GCS bucket locally, authenticate by running:

bash
Salin
gcloud auth application-default login
Run the application:

bash
Salin
flask --app main run --debug
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Deployment to Google Cloud Run
The application is designed to be deployed as a container on Google Cloud Run.

Build and Push the Docker Image:

bash
Salin
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/capstone-jobseeker-dd654/jobmate-api .
Deploy to Cloud Run:

bash
Salin
gcloud run deploy jobmate-api \
  --image gcr.io/capstone-jobseeker-dd654/jobmate-api:latest \
  --region asia-southeast2 \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars BUCKET_NAME=model-ml-jobmate,API_TOKEN=mysecretbearer123 \
  --min-instances 0 \
  --max-instances 1 \
  --timeout 300 \
  --cpu 2 \
  --memory 8Gi
Key Deployment Flags:
--image: Specifies the container image to deploy.

--region: Sets the deployment region.

--allow-unauthenticated: Makes the service publicly accessible (the application's own token auth provides security).

--set-env-vars: Injects the required environment variables into the running container.

--min-instances/--max-instances: Configures autoscaling behavior.

--cpu/--memory: Allocates resources for the service instance.
